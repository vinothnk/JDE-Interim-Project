# Sustainability using renewable energy

# Problem Statement
As climate change continues to plague the Earth (World Economic Forum, 2024),  it is important to study the economic and environmental aspects of the current Sustainability landscape.
To do so, we embarked on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) with sources extracted through ETL data pipeline

# Extract
